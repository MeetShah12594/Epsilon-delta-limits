# Epsilon-Delta Limits 🧮

A deep dive into the epsilon-delta definition of limits, inspired by Spivak's Calculus and MIT 18.01.

## 📘 What's Inside
- Formal proofs of basic limits
- Step-by-step breakdowns with diagrams
- Practice problems and examples
- Visualizations (in-progress)

## 🔧 Tools Used
- LaTeX for formal proofs
- Jupyter Notebooks (coming soon) for visualizations and numeric intuition

## 🚀 In Progress
- Visualizations of epsilon-delta conditions
- Problem set solutions from Spivak + Abbott
